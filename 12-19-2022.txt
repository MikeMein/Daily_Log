Recap of past week
 TLCL scripting recap

  Chapter 24-Writing Your First Script
    Writing Shell scripts
      Text files
    Making scripts executable
      File permissions: chmod 755 <file>
    File formatting
      #!/bin/bash
        #! shebang special meaning followed by PATH then type of script
      PATH variable might need adjustment: add export PATH=/bin:"$PATH"
      Apply changes to current term session: . <file> or source <file>

  Chapter 25-Starting a Project
    HTML system info report
    Variables & Constants in scripts
    variable=value value is a string make sure to quote 
    Here documents and here strings << <<- allows for indenting
  
  Chapter 26-Top-Down Design
    Structure of how the rest of the chapter build sys info report
      shell funtions and structure
#      name () {
          commands
          return
      }
      Great replacements for aliases, put in .bashrc or .zshrc

  Chapter 27-Flow Control:Branching with if
    if commands; then
      commands
    [elif commands; then
      commands...]
    [else
      commands]
    fi
    test
      test expression or [ expression ]
      string expressions
        string1 =~ regex
      [[ expression ]] compound test
        (( )) designed for integers
      Control Operators another way to branch: && || 

  Chapter 28-Reading Keyboard Input
    read command
      read [-options] [variable...]
    IFS:Internal Field Seperator
    <<< here string

  Chapter 29-Flow Control:Looping with while/until
    Looping: Make parts of programs repeat
      while commands; do commands; done
        break imnmediately terminates a loop
        continue causes remainder of loop to be skipped
      until is opposite of while

  Chapter 30-Troubleshooting
    Use syntax highlighting
    empty variables
    logical errors
      use test protocols to ensure proper program execution
      commenting portions of scripts with #
    Tracing
      #!/bin/bash -x
      set -x can turn on tracing
      set + turns off tracing

  Chapter 31-Flow Control: Branching with case
    case word in
      [pattern || pattern]...) commands ;;]...
    esac

  Chapter 32-Positional Parameters
    basename command removes leading portion of file name

  Chapter 33-Flow Control:Looping with for
    for (( expression1 ))
    while (( expression2 )); do
      commands
      (( expression3 )) 
    done

  Chapter 34-Strings and Numbers

  Chapter 35-Arrays

  Chapter 36-Exotica

Go thru a bit more Vimm with Vigor
Although the nmon graphs look appealing. iftop and nethogs are pretty dry terminal displays. Can probably colorize my iTerm2 a lot better but I havenâ€™t let myself play around with customizing it much at all.
